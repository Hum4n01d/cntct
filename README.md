# cntct - contact sharing made easy

It's a pain to quickly exchange contact information in a group of new people. Nobody likes to pass their phone around and keep track of whose information they caught.

### How cntct works

* One person creates a party and directs everyone to the cntct website with no installation
* Enter a five-digit party code to join the party and add your contact information
* Add contact info to your native contacts app from the party members list

The cntct web app works on any platform: iOS, Android, Mac, or Windows!
